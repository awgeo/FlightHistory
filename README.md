# FlightHistory
Seven years of flight data are provided for a Virgin Atlantic crew member, with detailed scheduling information for 700 flights worldwide. Data spanning Oct 2012 - Oct 2019 are provided in a series of Excel files ("Historical Crew Data"). More recent flight data (up to end-March 2020) can - with some effort - be parsed from an an iCalendar (.iCal) format. This combined data set is then merged with additional geographical data sets, including lat/long locations of airports. The final data set (flight_history_combined.xlsx) has been plotted in Tableau, see: https://public.tableau.com/profile/alan.wilson7526#!/
